# Weekly meetings

Copy/paste and fill in the template below each week, BEFORE coming to the weekly meeting with your supervisor. Put the newest weekly meeting first. 
### Date: 28-01-2019

#### What did you achieve?

* Did a more directed literature review into meta feature selection 
*	Background research in visualisation and statistical analysis of results

#### What did you struggle with?

* Making the distinction between relevant and less relevant literature

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalizing literature review
* obtaining the needed training data for the meta learning model

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Check whether proposed method for meta learning is viable


### Date: 22-01-2019

#### What did you achieve?

* Trained all of the 10 subsets of the decathlon dataset on VGG16, ResNet50 and MobileNet based encoder-decoder networks. 
*	Built framework to insert new pre trained networks easy
* Wrote research proposal: UPDATE https://www.overleaf.com/1856385788wchfdrhrjdbq


#### What did you struggle with?

* I wasnt able to set a goal for the end of my internship. The current research proposal is probably one or two months of work, but I think I can only know what comes next once I am a bit further in my research 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Identifying the meta-features that are useful to me 

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Feedback on research proposal 
* How can I set long term goals for this project?

### Date: 15-01-2019

#### What did you achieve?

*	Identified suitable pre-trained feature extraction models
* Built decoder network on top of pre-trained VGG16 model

#### What did you struggle with?

* It is not entirely clear if it is smart to fine-tune a pretrained network with the new data (especially for this project)
* I found a lot of good feature extractors, but I am not sure of a slection criteria

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* write a clear research proposal
 

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* To what extent do I need to finetune the pretrained networks and the new decoder part of the network?
* how many feature extractors to comnpare? 

### Date: 8-01-2019

#### What did you achieve?

*	analyzed the first try on meta learning with the decathlon datatset
* made a research proposal based on this first result

#### What did you struggle with?

* how to take the right conclusions from the work with the decathlon dataset
* how to asses whether a long term goal is attainable for my master project

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* adjust the research proposal based on the feedback from our meeting
* start with the first steps of the research proposal
 

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Feedback on the research prososal. I dont have it finished now unfortunately. I will post it on the main page of this github tomorrow before 11AM. If more convenient I can finish it a bit earlier. 



### Date: 18-12-2018

#### What did you achieve?

*	implemented Unet and started training all datasets on it 
* interpreted first results ('decathlon/december/results_december.csv'
* uploaded literature list and todo list to github (will be done before the meeting) 

#### What did you struggle with?

* running time
* what if the unet with a set of hyperparameters works on 8/10 datasets? is that acceptable?

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* work on meta learning approach
* monitoring unet training

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* no.2 of "what did you struggle with"

### Date: 11-12-2018

#### What did you achieve?

*	Read the given papers from last weeks meeting 
*	implemented Unet and started training all datasets on it 
* first outline of the meta learning method

#### What did you struggle with?

* whether I should do a 3D image segmentation or view the image as a collection of seperate 2d slices
* was ill for 4 days this week so wasnt able to achieve all my goals

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Obtaining Unet results on all datasets
* further design of meta learning approach. 

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* I chose to use a 2D unet instead of a 3D unet. Do you think this is a good decision?


### Date: 4-12-2018

#### What did you achieve?

*	Expanded literature review
*	Plan of approach
 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Determining how much time the first step/first prototype will take

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Get started with first step/prototype
*	Set up the lab computer (hopefully)


#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* How do I choose the semantic segmentation models? And what if one segmentation model just outperforms all other models for every dataset? 

### Date: 27-11-2018

#### What did you achieve?

* Better understanding of the concept of meta learning
* Initial iterature review
* Start of research proposal 

#### What did you struggle with?

* It is is hard to find a specific challenge/topic for my project
* Had to finalize work at CytoSMART, had my internship presentation and had a symposium this week which limited my time a bit

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* More extensive/directed literature review
* Write research proposal

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Ideas for interesting challenges in meta learning that fit with the current research in the imaging group
* format of the research propsoal 

#### Any other topics
