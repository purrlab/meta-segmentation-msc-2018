*	implemented Unet and started training all datasets on it 
* first outline of the meta learning method

#### What did you struggle with?

* whether I should do a 3D image segmentation or view the image as a collection of seperate 2d slices
* was ill for 4 days this week so wasnt able to achieve all my goals

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Obtaining Unet results on all datasets
* further design of meta learning approach. 

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* I chose to use a 2D unet instead of a 3D unet. Do you think this is a good decision?


### Date: 4-12-2018
